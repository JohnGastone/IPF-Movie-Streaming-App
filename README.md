## Features

- **Home Screen** showcasing popular and trending movies and TV shows.
- **Movie Detail Screen** displaying comprehensive movie information.
- **Actor Profile Screen** showing actor details and their movie credits.
- **TMDb API Integration** to fetch real-time movie and actor data.

## Libraries Used

- **google_sign_in**: To handle Google sign-in functionality.
- **google_fonts**: To use custom fonts in the app.

## Known Issues
